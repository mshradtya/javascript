      function Person() {}
      Person.prototype.dance = function () {};

      function Ninja() {}
      Ninja.prototype = new Person(); // assigning person object to Ninja prototype

      const ninja = new Ninja();
      console.log(ninja instanceof Ninja); // true - because ninja is a Ninja
      console.log(ninja instanceof Person); // true - because now prototype of Ninja is an instance of Person
      console.log(ninja instanceof Object); // true - because
      console.log(typeof ninja.dance === "function"); // true - now ninja can access the dance method

      // When we try to access the dance method through the ninja object,
      // the JavaScript runtime will first check the ninja object itself.
      // Because it doesn’t have the dance property, its prototype,
      // the person object, is searched. The person object also doesn’t have the dance property,
      // so its prototype is searched, and the property is finally found. This is how to achieve inheritance in JavaScript!
